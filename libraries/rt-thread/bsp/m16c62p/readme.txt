Summary:
========
This directory contains the source code for M16C porting to rt-thread

two tasks is running:
led_task - blink the LED
finsh    - a user shell, comes with rt-thread

Where to get help:
==================
In case you have questions about, problems with or contributions for
Renesas M16C prot to rt-thread, you can send a mail to dzzxzz@gmail.com. 

or you can post a message to the rt-thread forum
there are two forums:
http://www.rt-thread.org/phpbbforum

Where to get source code:
=========================
The rt-thread source code is maintained in google code
http://code.google.com/p/rt-thread/

use the following command to anonymously check out the latest source code:

Build Project:
==============
there are two ways to build the renesase M16C project:
1,  install IAR Embedded Workbench for renesas m16c(recommend EWM16C-EV-3501.exe)
    Open Workspace rtt2m16c.eww by IAR directly
    rebuild all
    the target file(rtt2m16c.mot) will be produced in /rt-thread/bsp/m16c62p/Debug/Exe
    you can download the rtt2m16c.mot to m16c board with E8A
                   
2,  install python, scons and IAR for m16c(recommend python2.7, scons1.3.1 and EWM16C-EV-3501.exe)
    open a windows cmd, and change directory to m16c project, like /rt-thread/bsp/m16c62p/
    #set PATH=C:\Python27\Scripts;%PATH%
    #scons -c
    #scons -j 2

3,  crate IAR project with template project
    #set PATH=C:\Python27\Scripts;%PATH%
    #scons --target=iar -s
    add the context_iar.asm to M16C62P, and remove the context_iar.S
